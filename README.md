# Building a Multi-Node Apache Kafka Cluster with Docker Compose and Custom Docker Image
## Create a Scalable and Custom Kafka Environment for Real-Time Data Processing

Apache Kafka is a widely used distributed event streaming platform that offers various capabilities such as efficient data pipelines, streaming analytics, seamless data integration, and robust support for critical applications. It empowers users to gather, store, and process data in real time, enabling the development of powerful event-driven applications.

However, this article takes a different approach. Instead of using the commonly used Confluent Inc. Docker images, we will guide you through creating your own Docker images using Ubuntu 16.04 (other Linux Images can be tried) and installing Apache Kafka on them.

The main objective of this article is to provide you with a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to configure and deploy a multi-node setup of Apache Kafka using Docker Compose. By following this guide, youâ€™ll be able to set up a custom Apache Kafka environment tailored to your specific needs.
